# collatzConjecture

This algorithm shows the nature of the collatz conjecture where selecting any natural number and running it through the algorithm will return the number one.
This algorithm uses recursion where the base case is the number being one and there are two funtions, odd and even, that have different rules for what should happen to the number.

This is only a simple algorithm but as of yet nobody has been able to prove it.
